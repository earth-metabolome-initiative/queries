#Digital Botanical Garden Initiative queries based on the EMI ontology

All .rq files were automatically generated with the [generate-rq-files](generate-rq-files) bash script. To do so, this script retrieves the queries stored in the RDF graph `<https://sib-swiss.github.io/sparql-examples/examples/dbgi/>` in emi-dbgi repostitory 
accessible via the SPARQL endpoint: https://biosoda.unil.ch/graphdb/repositories/emi-dbgi or with GraphDB workbench at https://biosoda.unil.ch/graphdb/sparql.

The queries in the RDF graph `<https://sib-swiss.github.io/sparql-examples/examples/dbgi/>` were loaded from the Turtle files available at https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples/tree/master/examples/dbgi
